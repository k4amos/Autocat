## Overview

Autocat is an intelligent wrapper for Hashcat that automates password cracking using optimized attack sequences for frenchüá´üá∑ passwords. It automatically manages wordlists, rules, attack methods and potfile used as a wordlist.

The password cracking method sequence for french passwords was obtained using the following code : [autocat-training](https://github.com/k4amos/Autocat-training)

‚ö†Ô∏è The README is currently under construction.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/k4amos/Autocat
cd Autocat
```

2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x autocat.sh
```

## Usage

Autocat uses the same syntax as Hashcat. The attack mode (`-a` option) is handled automatically based on the cracking sequence.

### Basic Usage

```bash
./autocat.sh -m [hash_type] [hash_file]
```

### Examples

Crack NTLM hashes:
```bash
./autocat.sh -m 1000 hashes.txt
```

### Supported Hash Types

Autocat supports all hash types that Hashcat supports.

## Configuration

### config.json

The configuration file defines paths to resources

You can modify these paths to point to existing wordlist collections on your system.

### cracking_sequence.txt

This file defines the attack sequence for frenchüá´üá∑ password. Each line specifies an attack type.
