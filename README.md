## Overview

Autocat is a wrapper for Hashcat that makes it easy to crack a cracking sequence without having to run each cracking method (wordlist with rules, brute-force) manually. Optimizations such as using the potfile of newly cracked passwords as wordlists provide significant performance gains.

Autocat comes pre-configured for FrenchðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· passwords: the cracking sequence in `fr_cracking_sequence.txt` was produced by Autocatâ€‘training: a large 2023 benchmark executed against an extensive dataset of French hashes aggregated from multiple sources, but you can set whatever sequence you want (for example for other languages) in the `cracking_sequence` field of the `config.json` file.

> [!NOTE]
> The technical explanations in the [Autocat-training](https://github.com/k4amos/Autocat-training) project's README provide a better understanding of the tool and the theory behind it.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/k4amos/Autocat
cd Autocat
```

2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x autocat.sh
```

## Usage

Autocat uses the same syntax as Hashcat. The attack mode (`-a` option) is handled automatically based on the cracking sequence. You don't need to specify the cracking method used (wordlist, rules, brute-force), as it is chosen automatically.

### Basic Usage

```bash
./autocat.sh -m [hash_type] [hash_file]
```

### Examples

Crack NTLM hashes:
```bash
./autocat.sh -m 1000 hashes.txt
```

### FrenchðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· hash cracking

Here is the list of rules and wordlists required by Autocat to crack French hashes, as defined in `config.json`, which are automatically downloaded if missing:

| Wordlist  | Rules |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| clem9669_wordlists  | clem9669_rules  |
|  | Hob0Rules  |
|  | OneRuleToRuleThemAll |

The wordlists come from this [repository](https://github.com/clem9669/wordlists) which was forked to prevent a change to the wordlists' structure from breaking the tool.

### OtherðŸŒŽ hash cracking

If you want to use other wordlists and rules, you can add them in the download_resources field of `config.json`.
If these resources are already present on your computer and you donâ€™t need to download them, the simplest way is to add their paths to the respective lists `additional_rules_path` and `additional_wordlists_path` in `config.json`.


## Configuration

### config.json

The configuration file defines paths to resources.

You can modify these paths to point to existing wordlist collections on your system.

### cracking_sequence.txt

This file defines the attack sequence for frenchðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· password. Each line specifies an attack type.

## Other Tools

- [Autocat-training](https://github.com/k4amos/Autocat-training) : Autocat-training aims to solve the **knapsack problem** using a **greedy algorithm** to determine the **most optimal password cracking sequence** for cracking a given input list of hashes and a list of cracking methods (wordlists, rules, brute-force) that you can specify.
- [cracking_curve](https://github.com/k4amos/cracking_curve) : This tool makes it easy to display the cracking curve obtained with Hashcat/Autocat.
